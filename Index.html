            </h1>
            <p>An eating plan that helps manage your weight includes a variety of healthy foods. Add an array of colors
                to your plate and think of it as eating the rainbow. Dark, leafy greens, oranges, and tomatoes—even
                fresh herbs—are loaded with vitamins, fiber, and minerals. Adding frozen peppers, broccoli, or onions to
                stews and omelets gives them a quick and convenient boost of color and nutrients.
